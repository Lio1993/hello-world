hi,it's my first time to use Github. I'm so happy to learn something new by doing this.I'm reading the User Guide and flling sth out like this.  I'm a student who study now for a master degree. although my major is Microelectronik , i really want to get myself involved into programming. I hope I could keep my enthusiasm on being a programmer.
